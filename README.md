# Open-Data-Portal
This is a project I worked on that aims to enable people to upload their datasets to the public so that it can be easily downloaded and managed.

To run this project first clone this repository and then make sure to run `npm install`  in both ./server and ./frontend.

Feel free to contribute to this project.
